            <p class="text-1"> Nigerian honey beans is very delicious and easy to cook.</p>
            <p>It is called <i>Ewa oloyi</i> in Yoruba language which literally means "beans naturally coated with
                honey"
                because of its natural sweetness compared to other beans. Back when i was a kid, i dreaded taking beans
                to school for lunch. This was because as kids, we always think beans is a "fart igniter" and for every
                fart in class that day, the beans eater will be tagged as the culprit. So i'd rather go hungry than eat
                beans in school. These days, I barely go a week without eating beans and i will proudly take it to work
                for lunch.</p>

                    <li><del>1 onion</del></li>
                    <li>75 mls Palm oil</li>
                    <li>1<small>1/2</small>teaspoon Nigerian grounded pepper or 1 chopped chilli</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoon Salt</li>
                    <li>1 Knorr stock cube</li>

                <h4>DIRECTIONS</h4>
                <ol class="numb">
                    <li>Place saucepan on cooker and add 400mls of water. Bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>While the water is coming to a boil, wash 300grams of Nigerian honey beans under cold water and
                        toss into the boiling water.</li>
                    <li>Add half the chopped onion and cover the saucepan. More often than not, the water will boil over
                        so you may want to cover the pan with half the lid or leave it uncovered completely so the steam
                        can escape.</li>
                    <li>Cook for 40mins. Keep checking the beans and add more water when needed. It takes about
                        40-50mins for the beans to get properly soft.</li>
                    <li>Add the other half of chopped onion, the pepper, palm oil, 1 Knorr stock cube and 2 teaspoons of
                        salt.</li>
                    <li>Add 100mls of water, stir together gently(if you already added too much water, just stir without
                        adding extra water) and simmer for 15mins on low heat.</li>
                    <li>Serve with fried plantain or any other accompaniment of choice.</li>
